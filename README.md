## Introduction

The applications of Artificial Intelligence in the field of Healthcare has seen rapid development in the present time. There is a lot of improvement scope that can be observed, and several implementations and upgrade can be brought to the existing AI technology. Collection of proper real-life data helps a lot in the implementation of efficient and accurate AI models. In the field of heathcare, accurate identification of diseases based on the patients' symptoms can be one of the first help that smart systems can provide to the doctors. However, due to very minor and negligible differences between quite a few diseases, along with the fact that new or unknown diseases can be found, predicting such diseases accurately can be problematic due to no availability of datasets. Therefore, Artificial Intelligence can still need to depend on actual doctors for identifying certain types of diseases. Keeping this fact and mind, we are generalising the aforementioned concept to create a system which recommends the user a specialised doctor based on the symptoms that they are faced by them.
