            The applications of Artificial Intelligence in the field of Healthcare has seen 
            rapid development in the present time. There is a lot of improvement scope that 
            can be observed, and several implementations and upgrade can be brought to the 
            existing AI technology. Collection of proper real-life data helps a lot in the 
            implementation of efficient and accurate AI models. In the field of heathcare, 
            accurate identification of diseases based on the patients' symptoms can be one of
             the first help that smart systems can provide to the doctors. However, due to very
              minor and negligible differences between quite a few diseases, along with the fact
               that new or unknown diseases can be found, predicting such diseases accurately 
               can be problematic due to no availability of datasets. Therefore, 
               Artificial Intelligence can still need to depend on actual doctors for 
               identifying certain types of diseases. Keeping this fact and mind, we are 
               generalising the aforementioned concept to create a system which recommends 
               the user a specialised doctor based on the symptoms that they are faced by them.
